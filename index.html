Celebrities want sympathy, All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone, Talkin' about how hard life can be

I'd like to see them spend a week, Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive, If they could spend a day or two
Walkin' in someone else's shoes, I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
They would fall, fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'  Always complainin'
If money is such a problem, Well, they got mansions
Think we should rob them

Well, did you know when you were famous you could kill your wife
And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were smokin' crack
McDonald's wouldn't even wanna take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.

I'd like to see them spend a week, Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive, If they could spend a day or two
Walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
They would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin', Always complainin'
If money is such a problem, Well, they got mansions
Think we should rob them ….(rob them)

[Interlude]

They would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin', Always complainin'
If money is such a problem, You got so many problems
Think I could solve them

Lifestyles of the rich and famous
We'll take your clothes, cash, cars and homes, just stop complainin'

Lifestyles of the rich and famous x3

            "digIn": `It's time to face and come-on in and join the party
Life has been waiting for you to care
Don't try to fake it, jump on in and get it started
There's so much loving for you to share

There is nowhere to run, There is no way to hide
Don't let it beat you, Say "nice to meet you" and "bye"

Once you dig in, You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in, You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

Wake up and shake it, you didn't make your contribution
There ain't no time for you to spare
If you ain't part of the game, then how can you find a solution?
Nobody said that it would be fair

When the mountain is high, Just look up to the sky
Ask God to teach you, Then persevere with a smile
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Once you dig in, You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in, You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

Once you dig in, You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in, You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

[Guitar Solo]

Once you dig in, You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in, You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

Once you dig in, You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in, You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

Once you dig in, Yeah, yeah, yeah
And once you dig in, You'll find you'll have yourself a good time

You say it's your way, You say we'll make it right to the top
Your bullshit gets me, what have you got?

I don't believe a word you say, You make me laugh, get outta my way
You say it's your way, Now listen to what I think of you

Son of a bitch!, Kiss my ass, son of a bitch!

I'll take one lift, Your ride, best trip
Always, I know, You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, Commiserating

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na  many times

Late night, come home, Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

Just say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na  many times

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

Say it ain't so, I will not go

Turn the lights off, carry me home

Starbucks is the place to go, when you need an espresso
Suck it down, Right away, You'll be wired, throughout the day

I'll build your garage, Won't take me that long
Won't damage your lawn, Be here and then gone

Fully licensed to do the job
Legally bonded and I'm cheaper than Bob
Got my number, give me a call
I'll start in summer and be done before fall

Just give me a call, I can build it all
Be right on the ball and be done before fall

I got my tools and my paint and much much more
Got carpet and linoleum for your floor
Got a flatbed truck with a John Deere tractor
Name is Bill, your general contractor

CATCH BIG AIR, DRINK MORE BEER

Early in the morning, gonna hit the slopes

Now she struts her stuff, Every time out and half
She boogies like no one else can, She don't know, know that I exist
But when they're on the road, She's the one I miss

She's all my world, my Sonics dance team girl

It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident, Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten x3
         
[Chorus]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench, One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this, I'll never be your monkey wrench

All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One in ten x3

[Chorus]

Temper x3

One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit Into my head
I still remember every single word you said, 
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free

[Chorus]

Don't want to be your monkey wrench 
(fall in, fall out) X4 `,
            "3LittlePigs": `Why don't you sit right back, And I, I may tell you a tale
A tale of three little pigs, And a big bad wolf

Well the first little piggy, well he was kinda hick-y
Spent most of his days just a-dreamin' of the city
And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood to become a star
But living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity
Then one day, jammin' on some chords
Along came the wolf knocking on his door

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin! x2
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in x2
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

Well the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoned
He spent most of his time just a-ganja smokin'
Huffin' and a-puffin' down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech
Built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks
Then one day he was cranking up Bob Marley
Along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin! x2
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in x2
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

Well the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent
Earned his Master's degree from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom paid for the bills
Then one day came the old house smasher
The big bad wolf, the little piggy slasher

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin! x2
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in x2
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

Well the big bad wolf
Well he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could
And lo and behold, the little piggy's house stood
"It's made out of concrete," the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned as he pouted
So they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
They sent out Rambo, just as fast as they could

"Yo, Wolf-face. I'm your worst nightmare. Your ass is mine!"
(gunshots)

Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
And that's the end of this story, for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may
Hear the big wolf or little piggies say

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin! x2
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in x3
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in! x4

And the moral of the story is that bands with no talent
can easily amuse idiots with a stupid puppet show `,
            "seeYouInHell": `See you in Hell!

Can I make you an offer, You can't refuse
I kept my eyes on you, Cause I tell you that you lose
And you can come with me  To a place you'll know so well
And I will take you, To the very gates of Hell

See you in Hell my friend x3
I'll see you in Hell!

Your choice's up then, How many sins can be yours
At my kingdom final choice, Is yours!
You can take it, Any time that you need
Next thing I'll borrow, All you've got to do is bleed

See you in Hell my friend x3
I'll see you in Hell!

Come with me, I will take you down
To the very depths of your soul
And I'll make you burn!

See you... see you in Hell! x2

See you in Hell!
Can I make you an offer  You can't refuse
I kept my eyes on you, Cause I tell you that you lose

            "22Acacia": `If you're feeling down, depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go (Go)
22 Acacia Avenue, Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time, And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for, Everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time, For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me, You might even get in free
So any time you're down the East End, Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it, She'll teach you more than you can know

Charlotte, can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease?
Some day when you've reached the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any more beautiful wares to show anymore

22, the Avenue, That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside, The red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte, isn't it time you stopped this mad life?
Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the Avenue
The way you walk, it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

22, the Avenue, That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside, The red light's burning bright tonight

Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want

[Instrumental Break]

You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte, you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good, don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you, don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you, stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me `,
            "trooper": `You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh x2

The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh x2

[Guitar Solo]

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh x2`,
            "breakingLaw": `There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside, it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law x4

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did, you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law x4

You don't know what it's like

[Instrumental Break]

Breaking the law, breaking the law x8`,
            "grinder": `Never straight and narrow, I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander, Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back

Grinder, Looking for meat
Grinder, Wants you to eat

Got no use for routine  I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene that's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bait the mantrap  Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere

Grinder  Looking for meat
Grinder, Wants you to eat

[Guitar Solo]

I've held my licence, It came with birth
For self-reliance on this earth
You take the bullet, On which my name
Was etched upon in your game

Day of independence  Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle  I need room to breath
Witness from the treadmill, I take my leave

Grinder  Looking for meat
Grinder, Wants you to eat

Grinder, Looking for meat
Grinder, Wants you to eat

Grinder `,
            "myOwnWorst": `Can we forget about the things I said , when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me...

Please tell me why my car is in the front yard,
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone

It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then I kick the living 
shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a 
cigarette, Still burning,

Please tell me why my car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone

Please tell me why my car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night

Ahooo
It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy

Ahooo
Can we forget about the things I said when 
I was drunk?
Ahooo

            "metalChurch": `Many, many years ago, on a distant shore
Men did gather secretly beyond a hidden door
They travelled long and travelled far
dark into the night
Yes, this is the place they've chosen
 to build the metal site

Congregation rises, starts to chant a hymn
Of evil, lust and hatred, the roots of every sin
The priest, he stands before them
tells them why they are this way
Why they worship metal gods, each and every day
By the hand of Oberon, dark into the deep
They love the evil things we do
the secrets that we keep

Metal church, unholy church, who'll be the sacrifice?
Metal church, the only church, you know the time is right
Metal church will find you, can't run very far
Metal church inside you, it knows just who you are
Who you are!

No use in speaking out against the things that we do
While the men of Earth, they sleep, haven't any clue
So, now, the story starts again, all the time is lost
Metal church begins anew, saving souls that are lost

Metal church, unholy church, who'll be the sacrifice?
Metal church, the only church, you know the time is right
Metal church will find you, can't run very far
Metal church inside you, knows just who you are
Who you are!

For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls, Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls, Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
